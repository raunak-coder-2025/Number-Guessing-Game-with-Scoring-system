# Number Guessing Game with Scoring System

This is a fun and interactive number guessing game built using Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and your task is to guess it. The game gives hints (higher/lower), counts your attempts, and gives a score based on how quickly you guessed the correct number.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Input validation to handle non-integer inputs
- Scoring system based on number of attempts
- Encouraging feedback messages
- Option to play again after each round
